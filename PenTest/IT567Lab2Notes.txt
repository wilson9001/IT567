Gathered using the "Page Info" page in firefox when visiting the site:

website uses https encryption at the transportation layer. Certificate is issued by DigiCert and it expires on Jan. 22, 2021.
The certificate was issued specifically to et.byu.edu. This suggests that the administrator of the larger .byu.edu domain has delegated pretty much all administrative duties and authority to someone else, so they are not as valuable of a target for our purposes as the administrator of et.byu.edu.
(They could, however, possibly be a good person to imitate in a phishing attack on an administrator of et.byu.edu)
This may be simply due to administrative decisions, or the .et.byu.edu domain could be large or complex, and it is necessary for it to have its own administrator.

The encryption protocols used are a version of TLS, using Eliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange, RSA asymetric keys, AES 128 bit symetric key encryption in Galois Counter Mode, and SHA256 hashes to verify integrity. The TLS protocol is the latest at V1.2

All of the images on the website are stored inside subdirectories beginning with '/images' and then by subdirectories named after the category of the image ('/welcome', '/donate', etc.) This means that it may be possible to dicover resources not intended to be public facing if lots of possible subdirectories are tried and the server is not configured properly to hide private resources.

Gathered using external web sources:
Querying for dns records by using viewdns.info reveals that it.et.byu.edu is actually an alias for www2.et.byu.edu, and the ip address of www2.et.byu.edu is 128.187.48.151
Going to www2.et.byu.edu redirects to engineering.byu.edu, however, so there appears to be some dynamic server-side redirection going on.
Going to et.byu.edu reveals a standard apache error page, giving me a Forbidden error and telling me that the server is an apache server running on port 443.
Going to it.et.byu.edu/foo gives me the same page.
This tells me that in later stages of a pen-test I should look for vulnerabilities related to misconfigured or vulnerable versions of apache web servers (if I can somehow figure out the exact version)

As noted below, whois lookup information yielded no information for who manages the it.et.byu.edu website, but by looking at the staff info page on the website, I found a guy by the name of Aaron Vivian, who's description suggests he is the domain administrator for it.et.byu.edu.
His work address and contact info are also listed on this page.
His linkedIn page confirms my suspicions, as he states in his current job description that he manages multiple Linux and Windows servers hosted on VMware and OpenVZ hypervisors as well as the it.et.byu.edu subdomain and associated networks.
He also says that he manages and mentors student systems administrators that aid in supporting this environment.
This is all great information because now I have a person associated with the network, and I have an idea of the servers being hosted on it.et.byu.edu.
It's also good to know that there are many less-experienced, less-knowledgable, and often-changing students managing the network, because it makes it more likely that there will be vulnerabilities on the network.
His facebook also gives information on the types of things he works on in his job, which I looked at a little bit but for the sake of time with this assignment I only read a little bit of it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gathered using whois lookup:
Performing a DNS whois lookup yielded only administrative information about the byu.edu domain, which as I have already deduced may not be useful for targetting but could be for imitation.
The contact info includes an administrative and technical contact, as well as 3 DNS name servers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gathered using powershell's nslookup utility:
edns1.byu.edu has an ip of 128.187.223.235
edns2.byu.edu has an ip of 128.187.223.243
edns3.byu.edu has an ip of 157.201.130.110
et.byu.edu has an ip of 128.187.48.161 on all nameservers.
This is very close to it.et.byu.edu's ip address (which is also the same on all 3 nameservers), which means they are likely hosted in the same local subnet or possibly on the same machine.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attempting to determine traffic patterns to site:
similarweb.com yielded very little information about it.et.byu.edu or et.byu.edu
This website looks at google search trends for website, as well as social media references, and found very little.
websiteiq.com had no information on either site.
alexa's ranking of the site only has statistics for byu.edu
The hope was to discover high and low points of traffic on the network, since that could be useful knowledge for the timing of later actions.

Gathered using maltego:
Using L3 scan:
The domain it.et.byu.edu has subdomains old.it.et.byu.edu, as well as ssh.it.et.byu.edu. The old domain is not reachable from a web browser outside of the network, and the ssh domain refuses connections on port 22.
Since this assignment is only footprinting, I will not dig deeper into the accessibility of these domains, but maltego found the ip address of the ssh domain to be 128.187.48.244, and that it belongs to a block of IP addresses that includes the entire 46.xxx address space.
Maltego found this block to be in Provo, Utah, and was associated with BYU, an Integra Telecom Route Object, and Electric Lightwave Inc. Both of these last two companies are now part of Allstream, Inc, according to a web search.
Using XXL Scan:
nothing
Using domain scan:
Graph included the higher up domains of et.byu.edu and just byu.edu
Found a few emails, phone numbers, and profiles associated with each domain. Some of the emails and phone numbers were overlapping.
Interestingly, maltego was able to find WHOIS information that I didn't find earlier when I used another WHOIS service.
The profiles seem to have been obscured. There are a few emails and phone numbers that seem to be legitimate however. None of them appear to belong to Aaron, so they could be outdated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using dmitry command line tool:
Attempted to gather netcraft info on domain, but the program kept erroring out. So I manually searched netcraft and found a few things, but I'm still going to count it as using this tool.
The domain does not have a sender policy framework or DMARC created, which means that it may be possible to forge emails from this domain as part of a phishing scheme.
dmitry did not find any subdomains or email addresses either
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using shodan search:
There wasn't any information about it.et.byu.edu specifically, but if I assume a subnet mask of /24 for the ip address range which includes it.et.byu.edu, then it does give me an idea of what else is on my potential subnet.
These include:
multiple apache webservers
multiple LANDesk manager servers
multiple citrix servers
a deserted minecraft server
an ftp server assocaited with the CAEDM lab
a windows server
lots of other connections that do not have more information than the IP address.
Shodan wanted me to pay them to get more results, so that's all I can find with that.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using DomainDossier:
Fleshed out a few details on some whois information, such as the roles and names of previously found profiles and emails in other tools.
The website's traceroute was ineffective, and it gave me a lot of info about the parent domains but not much else on it.et.byu.edu specifically.
