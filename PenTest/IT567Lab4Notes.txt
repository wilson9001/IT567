~~~Lab 4 Notes~~~
enum for linux to find users
have to use our password list (rock you wordlist is better? Create wordlist for second theme)
joker has powershell script
crackstation website will get windows password
drupal - php my admin
no passwords reused from drupal to linux box
linux box has different theme
custom jumbo wordlist for batman to get last password
ncrack with nt5 option to multithread

cewl - Used to scrape web pages to produce a set of words. Default follows links to a depth of 2, but this is probably excessive. Can be used to generate possible passwords, or building blocks for passphrases
Drupal user enumeration by looking up bug reports

metasploit
use scanner/http/phpmyadmin_login
set RHOSTS 192.168.207.122
set TARGETURI /phpmyadmin/
set Pass_File /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
run

if you listen to olaf's song, there's a word that he doesn't say in the song but you want to sing it every time

While many systems are setup to be ‘password breakable’, you will be focusing on two specific hosts in the exterior Behemoth network.  These hosts have been ‘themed’.

The two specific hosts you should focus on this lab are:
• 192.168.207.121
• 192.168.207.122 

1: Using the information you acquired in previous labs, identify the services running on each host that may be susceptible to password guessing attempts.

2: Try and get the hostname, this will be the host theme.
	a. Both hosts have a deliberate and specific weakness that will enable you to RAPIDLY enumerate users. If you are struggling to find this, talk to a TA.  Don’t waste huge amounts of time on user enumeration.
	
3. Create appropriate dictionary files for password guessing using tools such as CEWL.

4. Experiment with different password-guessing tools such as Hydra, Medusa, Patator, nCrack, nMap NSE, Metasploit password crackers, WFuzz etc.

5. Attempt to crack various protocols. 
	a. Be sure to read the recommendations in your tools helpfiles for tuning to specific protocols (eg:  RDP will not work with more than one thread). 
	b. Note the performance difference between various services and prioritize your efforts accordingly. 

6. Try to steal the password hashes once you have access to crack the remaining passwords. 
	a. To crack ALL the hashes, you will have to ‘mutate’ your wordlists.
		Combine words, experiment with cases etc.  
		(note that there are no “Mid-Caps” used.  Eg. you don’t need to try for “rOckSyOu”, but you should try “RocksYou”, the largest word combination is 6 words, but is a VERY common phrase for the account in question.  
		You should try ‘common’ password end chars once you have the hashes). 

7. Look for instances of password reuse, or services using the same accounts.

8. Write up the findings of your password audit in your Behemoth report.
	a. Be sure to include recommendations!
		Think about what weaknesses made it easy, or difficult to get in.
		Think about these recommendations.
		While ‘password complexity requirements’ is a good start, it certainly isn’t the only recommendation I want to see!

Note:  While there are MANY routes to the 208 network, there is a VERY deliberate and effective route that you will discover in this lab that will open up the 208 network.
