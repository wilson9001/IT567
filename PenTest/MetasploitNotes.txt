Flags

Linux:
in /root

Windows:
administrator's user folder (Might be in my documents?)

file name should have flag in it

Other things to find on these boxes

metasploit has search function:
	search blue
		gets all modules with blue in name

load module with use {path to module}
	options command shows options for module
set Rhosts to set targets

show payloads to show payloads
	these may work

set payload {path to payload, ex. meterpreter tcp shell}
call show options again to show payload options
set lhost to set our ip address

may have to run exploit multiple times for it to work.

can set global things like Rhosts with G?

ms-08-067 (eclipsed wing) on 102 reverse tcp exploit
hashdump command
reboot command to stabilize windows after exploit is done
